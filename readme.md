# Advent of Code

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Pascal-So/AdventOfCode.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Pascal-So/AdventOfCode)

My hacky Haskell solutions to this year's (and previous) [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com).

Test setup shamelessly copied from [Kris Jenkins](https://github.com/krisajenkins/AdventOfCode-2019).

All the input data (in the `inputs` directory) is stored in the format that is used on adventofcode.com. You should be able to replace these files with your own inputs and get the correct solutions to them, with the exception of year 2017 day 25, where I couldn't be bothered to parse the format but I might add that eventually.
